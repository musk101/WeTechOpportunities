# WeTechOpportunities
Looking back I realize how many opportunities I missed during my initial years so this website basically focuses on all opportunities for women students mostly.
I have added all the opportunities that I know but feel free to add any other opportunity that you know of according to the project structure.

We are currently working on making a website for the repository. Go through the documentation, issues and Contributing to learn more about how you can contribute!
